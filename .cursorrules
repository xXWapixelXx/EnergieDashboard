### User Stories by Role

#### Regular User Stories
1. Real-time Monitoring
   - As a user, I want to see my energy consumption in real-time
   - As a user, I want to receive notifications when consumption is too high
   - As a user, I want to manage my own devices (e.g., smart plugs)

2. Data Analysis
   - As a user, I want to view historical data
   - As a user, I want to customize my graphs (type and period)
   - As a user, I want to see predictions of my expected energy consumption

3. Settings & Preferences
   - As a user, I want to adjust notification settings
   - As a user, I want to manage which devices participate in monitoring

#### Admin Stories
1. User Management
   - As an admin, I want to manage users (create, modify, delete accounts)
   - As an admin, I want to view and manage notifications and alerts

#### Superadmin Stories
1. System Management
   - As a superadmin, I want to manage and retrain AI models
   - As a superadmin, I want to monitor system status
